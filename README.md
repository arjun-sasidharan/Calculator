"# Calculator"
I made this app as a learner who just started with android development and want to practice the basic learned things.
Here i used my own logic for this app which i surely think is very inefficient.
I didn't look at any other calculator projects but internet helped me to find some syntax needed to implement my logic.
As i said this app logic may not be efficient i don't want this app to be perfect either, as of now.
But even i admit all of these the app is all working.
And i will surely update the logic and implementation as my knowledge progress.
